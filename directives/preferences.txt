TERMINAL PREFERENCES:
- ALWAYS use cmd instead of PowerShell
- Run commands in foreground (not background)
- Prefer simple command line operations
- Always kill processes before starting dev server
- Always provide test command to run in foreground
- Server is already running on port 3000
- Use cmd.exe for all terminal operations
